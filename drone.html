					<h1 class="page-title">Three key pieces of automation helped secure the 2021 National UAS4STEM competition win - and $2500</h1>
				</header>
				<p>The <a href="https://amablog.modelaircraft.org/uas4stem/">UAS4STEM competition involves a team (usually around 7-8 members)</a> competing to complete a set of tasks within a strict time limit. The most important task to optimize (for my team) was one where we had to, in a crowded, object-filled junkyard, pickup payloads from targets scattered around the area and drop them off at different targets.</p>
				<h3>Problem #1: Landing accurately</h3>
				<p><img src="assets/images/Targets.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%"></p>
				<blockquote>Each of these targets was a square meter, placed randomly throughout an environment. The first is a pickup target and the second is a dropoff target.</blockquote>
				<p>The team earned more points the closer to a target they landed and this was a much greater challenge than one would initially think. Winds at Oshkosh were consistently 10 mph around the time of the competition, which not only forced our pilot to compensate for movement but also threw off his aim on the target. Our drone would have to tilt to not move against the wind, and the angle would make it look like we were above our target even when we weren't. The diagram below shows our solution to the problem.</p>
				<p><img src="assets/images/corrected_video.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%"></p>
				<blockquote>This solution would require us to pull pitch and roll data from the drone to correct the image accordingly. Not only did this help against the wind but it also kept aim accurate when making corrective movement - the tilt in the drone would normally make it hard to know if you've moved far enough.</blockquote>
				<h3>Design Elements</h3>
				<p>This solution required some hardwear changes. Our previous camera output the video directly to an analog transmitter to be seen back on the ground. That would not do for this project, so it needed to be replaced with a raspberry pi and digital camera, ontop of which we made our new OSD and vision system software. My plan for the landing system required 2 parts: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>A connection from the drone control system (MAVLink) which can provide pitch, roll, and altitude data to the Raspberry Pi which it will require to understand where it is</li>
					<li>A Raspberry Pi script which takes the place of a tradition on-screen display, creating a HUD ontop of live video, shifting the image so the center always points down, and feeding it to a video transmitter</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>End Solution</h3>
				<p><img src="assets/images/corrected.gif" alt="" width="70%" height="70%"></p>
				<h3>Problem #2: Autonomous points</h3>
				<p>Autonomous was in the name of the competition, and the organizers needed a way to incentivise teams to complete this task with as little human input as possible. Specifically, we could get half again the max amount of points in the whole competition if we got these autonomous points. GPS, however, was not precise enough for the landing, being accurate only to about 3 meters. So, we needed a way to land that relies on other measurements. I chose to make a camera setup that could see the targets and direct the drone accordingly.</p>
				<p><img src="assets/images/Landing.gif" alt="" width="70%" height="70%"></p>
				<blockquote>The green circle on the target is the computer deciding exactly where the center is - quite accurate under 20 meters.</blockquote>
				<h3>Design Elements</h3>
				<p>To tackle this problem, I would need the roll, pitch, and yaw inputs from the previous issue. With it, I would create another Raspberry Pi script which analyzes the data, searching for the target pattern. This script needs to return some value that determines the direction and magnitude of the drone movement required to land accurately on the target. The image search could be accomplished in two ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>An algorithmic approach, searching for the circles and rectangles that make up the target. This was the system that I personally worked on for the team as I saw its immediate applicable value in the stressful days leading up to the competition. It was, while accurate, quite computationally intensive. We did not end up using it that competition because it was completed too late to be trusted, but it has since been tested and proven effective. Essentially, we used a mode on the flight controller that accepts an input vector of the center of the target (corrected for height and angle of camera) and decides itself how fast to move.</li>
					<li>An AI approach, where where we train a model in a drone simulation software to detect targets itself and then try and apply that to real life. This is the system the team is currently working on, though I am no longer a member.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><img src="assets/images/landing.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%"></p>
				<blockquote>This is a picture from the current team. While my solution directly used the elements of the landing targets, the competition was revamped and targets became much less simple, requiring a different solution.</blockquote>
				<h3>Problem #3: Target GPS coordinates</h3>
				<p>In order to maximize the autonomous points, we would have to get the GPS coordinates of the points manually and then send the drone automatically to those locations before enabling our self-landing script. This was very time consuming, however, and the competition no longer allowed compeditors to go over the time limit for a penalty. I devised a script where I matched a picture to correct GPS coordinates so that, instead of hovering above each target to get a reading, we could instead just take a picture from high up, mark the locations of the targets on the pictures, and get the coordinates all in one shot. This system required 4 steps:
					<ol>
						<li>First, the GPS coordinates. I took a Google Maps image of the area beforehand and used a program I made to match each pixel of the image to a GPS coordinate, as determined by Google Maps. </li>
						<li>Second, I took an image of the current area (which had changed dramatically) the day before the competion with our drone. I then manually matched points on the this picture with my Google Maps picture.</li>
						<li>Then, during the competition, we took a photo from 50 meters up and automatically points on it against the picture the day before using a FLANN based point matcher. This allowed us to quickly find the GPS points of any target we saw in the picture.</li>
						<li>Finally, using the true GPS coordinate of our landing area and the recorded coordinate from the drone, we could eliminate GPS shift to more accurately get on targets.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p><img src="assets/images/matches.jpg" alt="" width="70%" height="70%"></p>
				<blockquote>This was an attempt at directly and automatically matching a new picture to a Google Maps picture. It was too unreliable to use, which is why I added the extra manual step, but from there it is simple to find the coordinate of any point in the new picture.</blockquote>
